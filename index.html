  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 1, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how RailTracker (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) handles your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>RailTracker does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No account registration</strong> is required</li>
    <li><strong>No names, email addresses, or contact information</strong> are collected</li>
    <li><strong>No analytics or usage tracking</strong> is implemented</li>
    <li><strong>No advertisements or advertising IDs</strong> are used</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
  <p>RailTracker may store your preferences (such as selected lines or settings) locally on your device to enhance your experience. This data is never transmitted or shared externally.</p>

  <h2>3. Location Data</h2>
  <p>RailTracker may request access to your location <strong>only if</strong> you enable features such as "Nearby Stations." Location data is used solely on-device to calculate proximity and is never stored or transmitted.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sources</h2>
  <p>RailTracker uses publicly available transport data from trusted third-party sources including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transport for London (TfL)</li>
    <li>Eurostar GTFS feeds</li>
    <li>Other European transport agencies (e.g., SNCF, RATP – future support)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No user information is sent to these third parties. Only public transport timetable and line data is fetched for display purposes.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose any user data to third parties, because we do not collect it in the first place.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Since no personal data is collected, there is no data retention. Any locally cached data (like transport schedules) is periodically refreshed or cleared by the app as needed.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>RailTracker is suitable for all ages and does not knowingly collect any data from children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Under applicable laws like the UK GDPR and EU GDPR, you have rights regarding your personal data. Since RailTracker does not process or store personal data, these rights are not applicable. However, if you have questions, you are welcome to contact us.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated to reflect changes in app functionality or legal requirements. We recommend checking this page periodically. The effective date will always be listed at the top.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
